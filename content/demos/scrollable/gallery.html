<p>
  This demo continues from the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a>
  and adds a simple <samp>click</samp> action to the scrollable items
  which will open up a larger version of the thumbnail image.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
  The scrollable setup is identical to
  the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a>. Nothing has been
  modified from that. Here we focus only on the elements that are
  required for showing the large image. First, we add a container for
  the image above the scrollable. Here is the HTML:
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
{{ standalone.html_excerpt }}
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  It's good to give those initial dimensions for the image so that
  there is no "jumping" on the page and everything stays stable.
</p>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
  We only add styling for the wrapper element:
</p>

{% filter syntax('css') %}
{{ standalone.css_excerpt }}
{% endfilter %}

<h3>JavaScript setup</h3>

<p>
  We add a <samp>click</samp> handler for the scrollable items. The
  idea is to load a larger version of the thumbnail image and while
  the image is loading we apply a simple transparency effect so that
  the user understands that something is happening.
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone.js }}
{% endfilter %}

<a name="alternate"></a>
<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>
  Our thumbnail images come directly from
  the <samp>www.flickr.com</samp> service and the associated larger
  images are simply the same image URL but without a "_t"
  substring. You are probably not using flickr, but it's very easy to
  make another kind of solution. Perhaps you can supply the large
  image's URL to the "alt" attribute of the thumbnail and get it like
  this:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
// in the above example replace the url assignment with this line
var url = $(this).attr("alt");
{% endfilter %}


<p>
  If you want to have more syntactically correct pages, you might want
  to enclose your thumbnail images with <samp>a</samp> tags and supply
  the large image's url in the <samp>href</samp> attribute and maybe
  add some image description to the <samp>title</samp> attribute. In
  that case you can have the interesting opportunity to add
  a <a href="{{ content_url('demos/combine/scrollable-gallery-with-tooltips.html') }}">tooltip
  for scrollable items</a>.
</p>

<p>
  It is fairly easy to change the setup so that the thumbnail images
  will load entire HTML pages with AJAX. This could result in some
  good user interfaces.
</p>
