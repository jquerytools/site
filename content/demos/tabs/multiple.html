<p>
  Since jQuery Tools 1.1.0 it is possible to instantiate multiple
  accordion (or tabs) instances with a single call. Here you can see
  five different Tabs where the last three of them have been nested
  under the second Tabs instance. This whole thing has been setup with
  a single call as follows:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
{{ standalone_tabs.js }}
{% endfilter %}

<div class="box">
{{ standalone_tabs.body }}
</div>
<a class="standalone" href="multiple-tabs.htm">standalone demo</a>

</div>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
  Now how do we know which panes belong to which tabs? The solution is
  to enclose each tab/pane combination inside the same parent (or
  wrapper) element. Here is our setup:
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
<!-- wrapper element for the first Tabs/panes combination -->
<div class="wrap">

  <!-- the tabs -->
  <ul class="tabs">
    <li><a href="#">Tab 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Tab 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Tab 3</a></li>
  </ul>

  <!-- tab "panes" -->
  <div class="pane">First tab content.</div>
  <div class="pane">Second tab content</div>
  <div class="pane">Third tab content</div>

</div>

<!-- wrapper element for second set of Tabs  -->
<div class="wrap">

  <!-- the tabs -->
  <ul class="tabs">
    ...
  </ul>

  <!-- tab "panes" (containing the nested Tabs) -->
  <div class="pane">
    [ nested tabs/panes #1 ]
  </div>
  <div class="pane">
    [ nested tabs/panes #2 ]
  </div>
  <div class="pane">
    [ nested tabs/panes #3 ]
  </div>

</div>
{% endfilter %}

<p>
  Each nested Tabs are contained within a
  separate <samp>div.pane</samp> which work as their wrapping element
  and they do not need any extra wrapper.
</p>

<p>
  Our jQuery selector: <samp>&gt; .pane</samp> searches for panes
  under the wrapper element. If we had used a simple selector such
  as <samp>.pane</samp> the second Tabs would have selected all the
  panes that are under the parent <samp>div.wrap</samp>. This would
  have contained 12 different panes altogether because those nested
  tabs are also contained by the <samp>DIV</samp> with
  the <samp>wrap</samp> class. This is why we need to select only
  the <em>direct</em> children under the wrapper with the <samp>&gt;
  .pane</samp> selector.
</p>

<p>
  If you don't use nested tabs or your instantiate your nested tabs
  with a different pane selector then you don't need to be as careful
  with these selectors as in the above setup. You can read more about
  multiple tab instances in
  the <a href="{{content_base}}/tools/tabs/index.html#multiple">Tabs
  documentation</a>.
</p>


<h2>Multiple accordions</h2>

<p>
  Here are two separate accordion instances that are instantiated with
  a single call as follows:
</p>

{% filter syntax('js') %}
  $(".accordion").tabs(".pane", {tabs: 'h2', effect: 'slide'});
{% endfilter %}

<div class="box">
{{ standalone_accordions.body }}
</div>
<a class="standalone" href="multiple-accordions.htm">standalone demo</a>


<h3 style="clear:both">HTML coding</h3>

<p>
  This time you don't have to worry about additional parent elements
  since in accordion setup the Tabs and panes are already inside the
  same parent element. Our HTML setup is identical to the
  previous <a href="accordion.html">accordion setup</a> but here we
  use CSS class names instead of <samp>ID</samp>s so that we can deal
  with multiple elements. Here is the structure for the above
  accordions:
</p>

{% filter syntax('html') %}
<div class="accordion">
  <h2>First pane</h2>
  <div class="pane"> ... </div>

  <h2>Second pane</h2>
  <div class="pane"> ... </div>

  <h2>Third pane</h2>
  <div class="pane"> ... </div>

</div>
{% endfilter %}

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
  Here we style elements with the <samp>.accordion</samp> class
  instead of a single <samp>#accordion</samp> element. Look at the
  standalone page for the full CSS declarations.
</p>

{% filter syntax('css') %}
{{ standalone_accordions.accordion_css }}
{% endfilter %}
